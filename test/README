The idea is to have a set of webapps (a set of xproject directories,
which will be like a Standard Fixture), a set of XSpec suites, and an
automated script which:

  - start Tomcat (Jetty?)
  - undeploy Servlex
  - delete the repo
  - deploy Servlex
  - build the webapps
  - install the webapps
  - run the XSpec suites

The XSpec suites will typically issue requests (using probably the
HTTP Client) to Servlex (to some specific webapps) and compare the
results.  There will be a file simple.xspec (for simple tests), a file
filter.xspec (to test filters, chains, etc.), and so on.

The script should be able to run all the test suites or just one (or a
few).  For instance only simple.xspec or only filter.xspec.


********** NEW **********

The idea is to be able to share the same Tomcat instance for several
tests, unit tests as well as functional and integration tests.  For
each of them, deploy its own Servlex instance to a different path.
For integration tests, create one for each website (H2O, EXPath, CXAN,
etc.), plus one per real instance on the server (as for now, one for
CXAN, and one for H2O + EXPath).

In a first time, run a few smoke tests to be sure it "looks ok".



********** TOMCAT CONFIG **********

I've changed the following files in the Tomcat dir:
- conf/catalina.properties
- conf/server.xml
- conf/tomcat-users.xml

[**] conf/catalina.properties

Added the prop org.expath.servlex.repo.dir (but should be removed if
(when) deploy seevral Servlex instances on the same Tomcat):

org.expath.servlex.repo.dir=/Users/fgeorges/projects/expath/servlex/test/test-repo
