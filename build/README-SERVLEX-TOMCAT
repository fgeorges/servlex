Servlex bundled with Apache Tomcat
==================================

To change the ports used by Servlex, look at the standard Tomcat
configuration file in conf/server.xml.  By default, it is bound to
port 19757.

To run Servlex, run bin/startup.sh (or bin/startup.bat on Windows
machines).  To shut it down, run bin/shutdown.sh (or bin/shutdown.bat
on Windows).

Once it runs, use your web browser to go to http://localhost:19757/
(or adapt the port number if you changed it).  The page should tell
you the installation was successful, and point you to the Webapp
Manager at http://localhost:19757/manager.  The Webapp Manager let you
install and remove webapp, packaged as XAW files (as described in the
EXPath Webapp spec at http://expath.org/spec/webapp.
