     For up-to-date information on Servlex, for the complete Install
   Guide and User Guide, please visit http://servlex.net/.

     Servlex is an open-source implementation of the EXPath Webapp
   specification <http://expath.org/wiki/Webapp>, based on Saxon and
   Calabash as its XSLT, XQuery and XProc processors.  It is developed
   as a Java EE application (based only on the Servlets technology).

     To install it, download the installer from the download area at
   http://code.google.com/p/servlex/downloads, execute it (e.g. by
   double-clicking on it) and follow the instructions.  This installs
   Tomcat pre-packaged and set up with Servlex.

     You can also download a WAR file from the same location, in to
   order to deploy it into your servlet container.  If you are looking
   for a container, you can use Tomcat from Apache which installs
   easily on all usual OSes, and provides a simple administration
   interface in HTML (just locate the WAR file on your system and
   press "Deploy").

     To finish the install, you have to make sure the property
   org.expath.servlex.repo.dir is correctly set to a directory where
   the webapps will be installed.  For instance in Tomcat, by adding
   in [tomcat]/conf/catalina.properties a property definition, i.e. a
   line like: "org.expath.servlex.repo.dir=/usr/expath/servlex/repo".
   This directory must exist and be empty.

     Once installed, you can access the Servlex admin interface at,
   say, http://localhost:8080/servlex/manager (assuming Tomcat is
   running on the port 8080).  From there you can deploy the sample web
   application in the release, hello-world-0.7.0.xaw, by filling in the
   form.  Go to http://localhost:8080/servlex/hello-world/ to access
   the sample once installed.  The sources are avilable in the dir
   hello-world/src/.

     This sample application is just three forms, sending a string to
   either an XSLT function, an XQuery function or an XProc step, which
   in turn displays a page based on this parameter.  You can use the
   tool at http://h2oconsulting.be/tools/dump to display the XML
   representation of the HTTP request which is send to the XSLT, XQuery
   and/or XProc components in a web application.
